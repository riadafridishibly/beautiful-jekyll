            OK, here we go. I've wasted my engineering career by doing nothing or you can say almost nothing.
            So here I am. I am onto something. I still don't know if I can do this. But I'm working on it.
            Maybe I'm not the best person to do this. If this countdown passed 1000 days and you see the red
            expired sign above, you can think of a few things. I am no longer alive or I've lost access.
            There's also a third possibility. I forgot what I was planning to do. In either case, you know
            I lost my track. Else I'm very much alive and you'll know what is happening.
