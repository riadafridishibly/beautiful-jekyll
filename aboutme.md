Hi! I'm Riad Afridi Shibly. I'm a 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering student at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna.

Even though I am studying mechanical engineering, I have a keen interest in computer science. I study algorithms, write & read code.

Currently, I am using [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) as my primary operating system. I prefer command line tools over graphical one. There's no specific reason for that. Most of the time they suck less than a graphical one. My primary text editor is [vim](https://www.vim.org). I write everything or almost everything in [vim](https://www.vim.org). I use Google docs and Google spreadsheet as a replacement of Microsoft office. Using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) is fun. I try to use it to write docs and make presentation. Now-a-days I'm learning LaTeX.

I started programming with C back when I was in HSC second year. I use C++ a lot and occasionally [processing](https://www.processing.org) for fun.
